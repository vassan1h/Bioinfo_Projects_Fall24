# Bioinfo_Projects_Fall24
Bioinformatics projects completed over the fall of 2024.

App_to_analyze_sample&counts&DE&NPA.R - This app takes the input sample, normalized counts and differential expression results datasets 
and visualizes them by doing bioinformatic analyses such as PCA, DE, and Reactome Panthway Analysis. It shows various plots and is interactive as well.

Project1.pdf is just a few functions created to work with various scenarios of evaluating genomes. Includes simple function definitions such as hamming distance, subsequence calculation, etcetera.

Project2 - is a replication of figures produced from this paper and dataset - 10.1016/j.taap.2023.116753.
